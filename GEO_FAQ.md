### General

**1. What is GEO?**
The GEO is a P2P transfer protocol for the decentralized network of assets.

**2. What is your goal?**
Our goal is to create a truly distributed network for transfer values. Just like sending the information within the Internet. 

**3. What is your product?**
The Protocol itself is our main product. We create a framework which enables businesses or developers to run their applications and ecosystems, as well as to connect to already existing networks of other applications which use different values (blockchains, local currency network etc). GEO Protocol is able to ensure secure, fast and cost-free transactions within the network. Moreover, it enables users to exchange with different cross-units (equivalents) and guarantees cyclic clearing.

**4. What problem does the GEO solve?**
The GEO Protocol solution is based on 2 main ideas which in short can be described as follows:

*Idea 1:* Creation of the network that can connect not only existing blockchain ecosystems but also the traditional finance ecosystem. It will solve the problem of [interoperability](https://hackernoon.com/the-need-for-layer-3-on-the-internet-of-value-85ae3ab2a9ea)

*Idea 2:* Creation of the network, where participants could transfer value in the form of equivalents. It could be backed asset equivalents and non-backed asset equivalents, which in fact obligations (IOU). It will solve problems of the existing monetary system.

**5. How your idea is similar to the original Ryan Fuger's idea?**
As a decentralized credit network, our protocol is the truly distributed realization of Ryan Fuger’s idea.

**6. Who can use GEO?**
Any person with any device (even a mobile device in prospect) could become part of the ecosystem. However, GEO Protocol is made mainly for developers and businesses, because they could connect e applications or ecosystems which will be the part of GEO Network.

**7. How can I use GEO?**
If you are a developer or business owner you can use the following manual (посилання на мануал для девелоперів) to connect your application or device or server to the network. If you are not a developer or a business owner the only way for you to use GEO Protocol is to register or enter any application or ecosystem which is attached to f GEO Network.

**8. What is GEO-Pay?**
[GEO_Pay](https://geo-pay.net/) is the first production usage of our technology. It is the first service  that uses GEO Protocol as the main technical framework. You can read more about this project here.

**9. Who is in your team?**
On GEO Protocol development are working 18 specialists - analytics, developers and marketers. However, our team is not yet totally formed. We seek for a C++ developer. If you are a hard-working and responsible person that have at least a few years of experience in coding on C++ - feel free to write us on jobs@geoprotocol.io. 


### Technical:

**1. What technology stands behind GEO Protocol?**
GEO Protocol uses 4  main algorithms:
1. *Topology Collection Algorithm*. It creates a topology map by obtaining information about the possible connections between the sending and the receiving node as well as overall payment capacity on intermediary nodes.
2. *Payment Path Building (Routing) and Maximum Flow Prediction Algorithm*. Considering the topology map it calculates the maximum possible flow that may be transferred from one node to another. It also seeks for the best route through which the asset could be transferred.
3. *Payment Algorithm*. It is responsible for the actual transfer of funds
4. *Cyclic Clearing algorithm*. It seeks for any debt cycles and closes them
Another key technical feature, which we are planning to introduce in next release, is the ability to connect nodes with composite channels.

**2. What is a composite channel?**
It is a type of connection between 2 nodes when both trustlines and state channels are used. 

**3. What is a trustline?**
Trustline is a connection between 2 nodes which allows them to account and transfer values between each other transfer value to each other. To get more information you can read the [article](https://medium.com/geoprotocol/trustlines-are-the-new-iou-5a10fde5881a) written by our CEO Max Demyan.

**4. What is a state channel?**
State channel is a type of connection that allows making fast, safe and trustless offchain transactions between two accounts from one blockchain ecosystem. However, cryptoasset is backed on the channel by onchain transactions

**5. Can I transfer any physical assets within the network?**
GEO Protocol enables free transfer of any assets or value in the network. Network participants can transfer both, backed asset equivalents and credit obligations (IOU). These are not physical assets, but they could be backed by custodian or state channels.
